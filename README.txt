Family Circle App Notes:
Version 1.0

General Description:

    I would like to create a platform where parents can log any monumental event within their family.  This includes child achievements/firsts (like first steps, first day of school, got 1st place in the science fair, etc), family vacation memories or special events.  The idea is that a parent(s) create a household and setup family members.  These can include children, grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins, etc. and they would be given permissions to access the household.  Limitations would be set per the parents.  
  
    Any member can request to post to the household (ex: Grandma takes the kids to the orchard and got some good pictures of picking apples), the parents would then approve or deny the post and also make the picture available to view to all (or restrict various members if needed *say there's a surprise that you didn't want to spoil like a picture or status update of a gift for grandpa).

    The main concept is to provide a space where family near and far can share in an environment that isn't open to the world.  No data mining.  No directed ads.  No stranger peeking into your family photos and getting information that you don't want others to have.

    Roles wouldn't be able to share through their own household.  Ex: Your aunt can't share a photo from your household to their own.  This is to simply avoid it spreading beyond the individuals control and becoming available to others that the original owner didn't want it to be.
