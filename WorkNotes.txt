Progress Notes:
    - Perhaps adding a NOW() DataType to other tables.
    - MySQL supports 4 types of BLOB data type which only differ in the maximum length of data they can store. Here is a summary of the different types:

            TINYBLOB: Only supports up to 255 bytes.
            BLOB: Can handle up to 65,535 bytes of data.
            MEDIUMBLOB: The maximum length supported is 16,777,215 bytes.
            LONGBLOB: Stores up to 4,294,967,295 bytes of data.
